- Refactor CQ/Cntr bindings, CQ completion generation, and counter
  increments
- Copy compare data to internal buffer when FI_INJECT is set in
  fi_compare_atomic
- Correctly handle triggered operation when FI_INJECT is set or
  triggered op is enqueued or counter is incremented. Initialize
  counter threshold to INT_MAX
- Refactor and cleanup connection management code, add locks to avoid
  race between main thread and progress thread, add logic to correctly
  handle FI_SHUTDOWN and FI_REJECT
- Set fabric name as network address in the format of a.b.c.d/e and
  domain name as network interface name
- Remove sock_compare_addr and add two utility functions ofi_equals_ipaddr
  and ofi_equals_sockaddr in fi.h
- Refactor fi_getinfo to handle corner cases and add logic if a given
  src_addr matches to any local interface addr
- Restructure acquiring/releasing the list_lock in progress thread so
  that it is only acquired once per iteration
- Refactor connection management of MSG ep so that it uses TCP instead
  of UDP for connection management msg and new port for every MSG
  endpoint
- Add sock_cq_sanitize_flags function to make sure only flags returned in
  CQ events are the ones that are listed on the manpage
- Update fi_poll semantics for counters so that it returns success if the
  counter value is different from the last-read-value
- Allow multiple threads to wait on one counter
- Update code to use ofi_util_mr - the new MR structure added to util code
- Fix fi_av_insert not to report error when the number of inserted addr
  exceeds the count attribute in fi_av_attr

  in AV and cleanup conn map during fi_av_remove
- Use correct fi_tx_attr/fi_rx_attr for scalable ep

## UDP provider notes

- Enhance parameter checks for several function calls.
- Fix memory leak freeing CQ structure.
- Bind to a source address when enabling endpoint.
- Reduce reported resource limits (domain attributes).

## usNIC provider notes

- Fix handling of EP_MSG peers on different IP subnets [PR #1988]
- Fix handling of CM data. Fixes a bug where data received would
  overwrite parts of the connection management structure [PR #1991]
- Fix bug in CM connect/accept handling that would cause a seg fault
  if data was sent as part of a connection request [PR #1991]
- Fix invalid completion lengths in the MSG and RDM endpoint
  implementations of fi_recvv and fi_recvmsg [PR #2026]
- Implement the FI_CM_DATA_SIZE option for fi_getopt on passive
  endpoints [PR #2033]
- Add fi_reject implementation that supports data exchange [PR #2038]
- Fix fi_av_straddr bug that reported port in network order [PR #2244]
- Report -FI_EOPBADSTATE if the size left functions are used on an
  endpoint which has not been enabled [PR #2266]
- Change the domain/fabric naming. The fabric is now represented as
  the network address in the form of a.b.c.d/e and the domain name is
  the usNIC device name. For more information see fi_usnic(7) [PR
  #2287]
- Fix the domain name matching in fi_getinfo/fi_domain [PR #2298]
- Fix issue with AV where it is fully closed before pending
  asynchronous inserts can finish leading to invalid data accesses [PR

  #2397]
- Fail with -FI_EINVAL if a value of FI_ADDR_NOTAVAIL is given to
  fi_av_lookup.  [PR #2397]
- Verify AV attributes and return an error if anything that is
  unsupported is requested (FI_AV_TABLE, named AVs, FI_READ, etc.) [PR
  #2397]

## Verbs provider notes

- Add fork support. It is enabled by default and can be turned off by
  setting the FI_FORK_UNSAFE variable to "yes". This can improve
  performance of memory registrations but also makes fork unsafe. The
  following are the limitations of fork support:
  - Fabric resources like endpoint, CQ, EQ, etc. should not be used in
    the forked process.
  - The memory registered using fi_mr_reg has to be page aligned since
    ibv_reg_mr marks the entire page that a memory region belongs to
    as not to be re-mapped when the process is forked (MADV_DONTFORK).
- Fix a bug where source address info was not being returned in
  fi_info when destination node is specified.

- verbs/MSG
  - Add fi_getopt for passive endpoints.
  - Add support for shared RX contexts.
- verbs/RDM
  - General bug fixes
  - Add FI_MSG capability
  - Add FI_PEEK and FI_CLAIM flags support
  - Add completion flags support
  - Add selective completion support
  - Add fi_cq_readerr support
  - Add possibility to set IPoIB network interface via FI_VERBS_IFACE
    environment variable
  - Add large data transfer support (> 1 GB)
  - Add FI_AV_TABLE support
  - Add fi_cntr support
  - Add environment variables for the provider tuning:
    FI_VERBS_RDM_BUFFER_NUM, FI_VERBS_RDM_BUFFER_SIZE,
    FI_VERBS_RDM_RNDV_SEG_SIZE, FI_VERBS_RDM_CQREAD_BUNCH_SIZE,
    FI_VERBS_RDM_THREAD_TIMEOUT, FI_VERBS_RDM_EAGER_SEND_OPCODE
  - Add iWarp support
