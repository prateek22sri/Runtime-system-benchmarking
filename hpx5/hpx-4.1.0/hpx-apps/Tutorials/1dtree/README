A simple 1d tree code for computing the gravitational potential of a
set of point masses.

To build the example code one should perform the following steps:

1) run `bootstrap'

2) run `configure'. If your environment is already setup for HPX-5, there
   should be no need to specify any options for configure.

3) run `make'.

To run the code, in addition to any instructions that are relevant for any
HPX-5 program, you will need to provide four command line arguments. If you
forget, or provide too few arguments, the program will remind you what
needs to be provided.

> ./treetut 1000 10 0.6 10.0

The previous specifies that 1000 particles are to be generated, the tree
will refine if a node contains more than 10 particles, the critical angle
for the potential computation (tree traversal) is 0.6 and the particles
are distributed on an interval from x=0 to x=10.0.

You may need to use your system provided distributed job launcher to run the
executable `treetut`. As an example, if you compiled 1dtree with mpicc wrapper 
or built HPX with mpi, use mpirun launcher to run the binary. For example:

mpirun -np 1 ./treetut 1000 10 0.6 10.0
