Welcome to the HPX-5 runtime system library! 

The HPX–5 distribution contains two top-level directories.

/hpx
This contains the HPX–5 interface and runtime library implementation, along with
 examples, the test suite, and third-party dependencies. The project installs 
the HPX–5 headers and the libhpx.{a,so} runtime library, along with built 
dependencies and an hpx.pc file for use with pkg-config for external projects.

/hpx-apps
This contains example applications designed to depend on an installed instance 
of HPX–5, and should serve as a usage model. In particular, it includes a 
tutorial as well as the Lulesh, Wavelet-AMR, HPCG, CoMD, and SSSP applications.
