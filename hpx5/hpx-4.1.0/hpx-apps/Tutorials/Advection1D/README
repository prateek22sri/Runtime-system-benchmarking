Advection tutorial
====================

The problem considered in the tutorial is the one-dimensional advection 
equation. A detailed tutorial can be found at: 
http://hpx.crest.iu.edu/tutorials.

To build the example code one should perform the following steps:

1) run `bootstrap'

2) run `configure'. If your environment is already setup for HPX-5, there
   should be no need to specify any options for configure.

3) run `make'.

Running the code requires nothing on top of what is needed on your system to
run an HPX-5 application. The advection tutorial codes do not require any
command-line arguments.

For example:
> mpirun -np 1 ./advection0
