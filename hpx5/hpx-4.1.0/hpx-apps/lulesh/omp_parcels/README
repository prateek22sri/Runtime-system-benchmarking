This version of lulesh takes the following arguments:
  * -n <domain> is the number of domains over which to run
  * -x <points> is the number of points each domain will have
  * -i <iterations> is the number of iterations to perform

Note that the number of domains must be cubic.

This version of lulesh works best when the number of nodes (not cores) available
is the same as the number of domains.
